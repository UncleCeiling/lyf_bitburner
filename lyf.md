# [Learn you some JavaScript for fun](https://quacksouls.github.io/lyf/)

A tutorial on learning to program in JavaScript. We will use the game Bitburner as a vehicle for learning. The game is available online and through Steam.

## Hello World

This tutorial will help you learn computer programming. We will use JavaScript as the programming language and the game Bitburner as the learning environment. Why JavaScript? Why not Python? Or C, C++, Java, Ruby, or some other language? I find JavaScript to be reasonably easy to learn. Python is also easy to learn. However, I have not been able to find a programming game that encourages its players to write, say, Python or Ruby code. Let me know if you encounter such a game for Python or Ruby or another language. The game [ByteLegend](https://github.com/ByteLegend/ByteLegend) encourages its players to write Java code. If you prefer Java, give ByteLegend a go.

Why Bitburner? The game encourages you to write JavaScript code, not in a programming language specifically designed for the game. Isn’t that the same purpose as [Screeps](https://store.steampowered.com/app/464350/Screeps_World/) and [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/)? Yes. I have spent much more time with Bitburner than I have with Screeps or Untrusted. By all means use Screeps and/or Untrusted to learn JavaScript if you are so inclined. Bitburner offers plenty of challenges for novice and seasoned programmers. It is possible to write JavaScript programs that can automate the whole game for you. Any discussion about how to play Bitburner is incidental to our main goal: use the game to learn how to program in JavaScript.

### Bitburner

Familiarize yourself with the Bitburner environment. Open the game in Steam or use the online version. You should see something similar to the left panel of the image below. The game places you at the in-game tutorial. Continue with the tutorial if you want. Otherwise click the button `SKIP TUTORIAL` and you should see something like the right panel of the image below. This is the terminal window of the game. The terminal window, abbreviated as terminal, is an area of the game that allows you to type in various commands to play the game. You know you are at the terminal because the `Terminal` tab is highlighted green. Spend some time exploring the other tabs. When you are done, click on the `Terminal` tab to return to the terminal. Note the `Overview` window at the top-right corner. Click on the arrow to minimize or maximize the window.

Thank you for reading this far. I hope the tutorial has helped you to learn programming in JavaScript. Better resources are available that cover the language in more depth. To help you progress in your journey to mastery of JavaScript, you might find the following useful:

1. Choose a book that covers basic JavaScript in more depth. You do not need to read the book from start to finish. Read a chapter or section. If you are confused/unsure of something you read, search online for more details or explanation. You might find the introductory book [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) useful.
2. Learn about algorithms and data structures. These resources can help:
    - [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) - An interactive course on JavaScript. Covers basic of the language as well as more advanced topics.
    - [Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript) – A video course.
    - [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP) – Another video course.
    - Any introductory book on algorithms and data structures in JavaScript.
3. Learn about functional programming in JavaScript. These resources might help:
    - [An introduction to functional programming in JavaScript](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript) – A short article on fundamental principles of functional programming.
    - [Dr J R Sinclair](https://jrsinclair.com) – A blog on various techniques of functional programming and how to use them in JavaScript.
    - [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) – A book on basic principles of functional programming.
