# Bitburner

Familiarize yourself with the Bitburner environment. Open the game in Steam or use the online version. You should see something similar to the left panel of the image below. The game places you at the in-game tutorial. Continue with the tutorial if you want. Otherwise click the button `SKIP TUTORIAL` and you should see something like the right panel of the image below. This is the terminal window of the game. The terminal window, abbreviated as terminal, is an area of the game that allows you to type in various commands to play the game. You know you are at the terminal because the `Terminal` tab is highlighted green. Spend some time exploring the other tabs. When you are done, click on the `Terminal` tab to return to the terminal. Note the `Overview` window at the top-right corner. Click on the arrow to minimize or maximize the window.
