# Bitburner

> Familiarize yourself with the Bitburner environment.  
> Open the game in Steam or use the online version.  
> You should see something similar to the left panel of the image below.  
> The game places you at the in-game tutorial.  
> Continue with the tutorial if you want.  
> Otherwise click the button <kbd>SKIP TUTORIAL</kbd> and you should see something like the right panel of the image below.  
> This is the terminal window of the game.  
> The terminal window, abbreviated as terminal, is an area of the game that allows you to type in various commands to play the game.  
> You know you are at the terminal because the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> tab is highlighted green.  
> Spend some time exploring the other tabs.  
> When you are done, click on the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> tab to return to the terminal.  
> Note the <kbd>Overview</kbd> window at the top-right corner.  
> Click on the arrow to minimize or maximize the window.

## Exercise 1

> Launch Bitburner via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/) or visit the [online version](https://bitburner-official.github.io/).  
> Get to know the interface and what the various tabs have to offer.

✅ I'll be using the Online version for this.

## Exercise 2

> The objective of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the Bitburner environment.  
> Complete the in-game tutorial.  
> Don’t worry if you do not understand everything in the in-game tutorial.  
> You can restart the in-game tutorial by closing your web browser and load the online version of the game again.  
> You might have to delete all browser cookies before loading the online version of the game.  
> Alternatively, the following technique works for both the Steam and online versions of Bitburner.  
> Click on the tab <kbd>Options</kbd> and click on the button <kbd>Delete Save</kbd> for a hard reset as if you start Bitburner for the very first time.  
> The hard reset will delete your save file.  
> Perform a hard reset if you do not care about your save file or you have a backup save file.

✅ Done and done.

## Exercise 3

> The [online tutorial](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/src/Documentation/doc/help/getting_started.md) elaborates on the in-game tutorial.
