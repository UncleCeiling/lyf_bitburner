# Your first program

> When learning a programming language, the traditional first program you write is called the `Hello, world` program.  
> At the terminal, type `nano hello.js` as shown in the left panel of the image below and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
> The command `nano` launches an editor in which you can write your JavaScript code.  
> The argument `hello.js` given to `nano` tells the command to open the code editor and create a template file named `hello.js`.  
> The command uses the file extension `.js` to figure out that you want to create a JavaScript program.  
> The code editor is shown in the right panel of the image below.  
> If you have not done so, explore other tabs and familiarize yourself with the gameâ€™s interface.  
> When you are ready to code, click on the tab <kbd>Script Editor</kbd> (or press the key combination <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>>) to return to the code editor.
>
> Copy and paste the following program into the code editor:

```javascript
/** @param {NS} ns */
export async function main(ns) {
    ns.tprint("Hello, world!");
}
```

> Click on the button <kbd>Save</kbd> (or press the key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>) to save the content of the script.  
> Click on the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> tab (or press the key combination <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>) to return to the terminal.  
> At the terminal, type the command `run hello.js` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run your first JavaScript program.  
> The result is shown in the following image.  
> You should see the text `Hello, world!` printed to the terminal.

## Exercise 1

> The terminal is the area of Bitburner that allows you to enter commands and run scripts.

___

âœ… Done ðŸ‘“

## Exercise 2

The terminal accepts a number of commands.  
> You have been using the command `run`.

> Do not worry if you find the information incomprehensible.

___

âœ… Like Linux, but *less*

## Exercise 3

## Exercise 4

> Might I interest you in a feline companion?
